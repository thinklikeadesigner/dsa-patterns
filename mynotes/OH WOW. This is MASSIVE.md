 OH WOW. This is MASSIVE. Let me break down what you just landed:

  ---
  🎯 What Just Happened

  You got invited to present at an Elastic Austin meetup on search architecture — a
  topic directly aligned with platform engineering roles. This is:

  1. Public speaking credibility — "presented at Elastic meetup" goes on LinkedIn +
  resume
  2. LinkedIn content goldmine — carousel, post, video clips
  3. Direct line to Elastic DevRel/engineers — Olivia (Program Manager) + Sophia
  (Developer Advocate in Austin)
  4. Networking leverage — meetup = room full of engineers, potential referrals
  5. Technical depth signal — you're being positioned as someone who knows search
  architecture tradeoffs

  📋 Action Items

  Immediate (This Week)

  1. Meeting with Sophia — Workshop the talk angle. This is your prep meeting (likely
  tomorrow Thu or soon).
  2. Prep for Sophia call:
    - Your WP search architecture work (indexing pipeline, relevance tuning, semantic vs
   keyword tradeoffs)
    - Your technical depth on Elastic vs native WP search
    - Angle: "When to use Elastic vs when native search is enough" (practical,
  tradeoff-driven)
  3. Add contacts to network:
    - Olivia Petrie (Elastic Program Manager, DevRel)

  💡 Strategic Value

  This is a side quest that PASSES the filter because:
  - ✅ Public speaking = resume bullet + LinkedIn content
  - ✅ Networking = room full of engineers + potential referrals
  - ✅ Technical credibility = "presented at Elastic meetup" signals platform
  engineering depth
  - ✅ Low time cost = 1 meeting to workshop, 2-3 hrs to prep slides, 1 event to present

  Timeline fit:
  - Workshop call: This week (Feb 12-13)
  - Prep time: 2-3 hrs (can fit in Feb Flex hours or early March)
  - Presentation: Likely March or April (after Phase 1, during Phase 2-3)
