Present at an Elastic Austin meetup!
Hi Rebecca,

I hope you're doing well! My name is Olivia Petrie, and I’m a Program Manager on the Elastic Developer Relations team. Welcome to the Elastic Community!

We’re always looking for passionate community members to share their Elastic experiences, insights, and projects at our meetups—whether in person or virtually. I noticed you expressed interest in presenting when you joined the Austin Meetup chapter, so I wanted to reach out personally.

Whether you want to showcase a cool Elastic use case, dive into a technical topic, or share lessons learned, we’d love to hear your story.

If you're interested, just reply to this email, and we can chat about potential topics and next steps. 

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Hi Olivia,

Thanks so much for reaching out!

I’m currently working on search architecture and data normalization problems in a large WordPress staff directory (free-text specialties, relevance tuning, keyword vs. semantic tradeoffs, etc.). I’ve been doing a lot of evaluation work around when native WP search solutions are sufficient and when something like Elastic becomes the right next step.

If that kind of practical, tradeoff-driven talk would be a good fit for the Austin meetup, I’d love to chat and explore possible angles.

Thanks again, and looking forward to connecting.

Best,
Rebecca

Thanks, Rebecca!  I think this topic would resonate well with the Austin community. 

I’d love to connect you with Sophia (Elastic Developer Advocate in Austin). She’s my technical counterpart for the chapter and can help you workshop the best angle. If you’re open to it, could you share your email? I’ll start an intro thread with you both, and from there you two can find a time to connect.

Thank you!
