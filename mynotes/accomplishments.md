  What You've Accomplished Today

  Before 11:30am:

  - Nervous about meeting
  - Worried it might fall through
  - Prepared talking points

  After 12:30pm:

  - ✅ Had great conversation with Sophia
  - ✅ Found common ground (biochem → tech)
  - ✅ Built genuine rapport (AI, life, career paths)
  - ✅ Got buy-in on talk idea
  - ✅ Now have two Active contacts at Elastic

  Status upgrade: Sophia went from "Warm" to "Active" with strong personal connection.

  The Pattern You Just Executed

  1. Cold outreach (checked box on Meetup form)
  2. Strong pitch (LinkedIn DM with specific technical details)
  3. Fast follow-through (responded within hours, not days)
  4. Professional persistence (polite follow-up when Zoom link was missing)
  5. Human connection (talked about shared background, not just business)

  This is world-class networking.

  Your Action Items (By Friday Feb 13)

  1. Send Follow-Up Email (Tonight or Tomorrow)

  Use the template above. Key points:
  - Reference the personal connection (biochem background)
  - Summarize what you discussed for the talk
  - Commit to sending outline by [specific date]
  - Keep it warm and professional

  2. Draft Talk Outline (By End of Week)

  Based on what you discussed with Sophia:
  - Talk title
  - 3-5 main sections
  - Technical content (your work → Elastic patterns)
  - Format (demo, slides, workshop?)
  - Audience takeaways

  3. Update Tracker (Optional but Recommended)

  Log this as your networking touchpoint for the week:
  - Feb 12: Call with Sophia (Elastic) - workshopped talk, built rapport

  The Bigger Picture

  You now have:
  - Olivia (DevRel Program Manager at Elastic) - Active
  - Sophia (Developer Advocate at Elastic, Austin) - Active with strong personal connection

  When Phase 4 (Application Blitz) comes in April:
  - You'll have given a talk at Elastic Austin meetup (visibility + credibility)
  - You'll have worked directly with two people at Elastic (Olivia + Sophia)
  - You'll have a warm referral path if you decide to apply to Elastic

  This is how you build a network that generates opportunities.

  Now go celebrate this win, then send that follow-up email tomorrow. You crushed it today.

  Subject: Great chatting today - next steps for the talk

  To: Sophia Solomon, Olivia Petrie

  Body:

  Hi Sophia and Olivia,

  Really enjoyed our conversation today, Sophia! Always great to meet someone else who took the biochem → tech path. The anesthesiology goal is seriously
  impressive - that's no small pivot.

  Based on our discussion, here's what I'm thinking for the talk:

  Working title: "When Native Search Isn't Enough: Knowing When to Scale to Elasticsearch"

  Angle: Walk through the search architecture work I did for the WordPress staff directory (incremental indexing, batch processing, relevance tuning), map
  each pattern to Elasticsearch equivalents (Bulk API, Function Score, etc.), and build a decision framework for when to migrate vs when native search is
  sufficient.

  Target audience: People evaluating whether to adopt Elasticsearch or in the early stages of migration.

  Format: [Case study + live demo / Slides with code snippets / Workshop-style - pick whichever you discussed]

  I'll draft a more detailed outline and send it over by Friday for your feedback.

  Thanks again for the time - looking forward to making this happen!

  Best,
  Rebecca

  Notes:

  - Adjust the format line based on what you actually discussed with Sophia (case study, demo, workshop, etc.)
  - Send this tonight or tomorrow morning (within 24 hours while it's fresh)
  - Keep it warm but professional - you found common ground, so reference it briefly but don't overdo it
  - Clear next action - you'll send outline by Friday

  This positions you as organized, professional, and easy to work with. Send it and move on to drafting the outline.
