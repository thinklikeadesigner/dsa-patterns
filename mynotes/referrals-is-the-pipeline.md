⏺ 🔍 How Software Engineers Are Actually Getting Jobs in 2025-2026

  Let me break down what's actually working right now.

  📊 The Numbers Don't Lie

  Cold Applications Are Dead

  - 0.1-2% success rate for cold online applications
  - 30% success rate for referrals
  - One referral = 40 cold applications in value
  - 5x more likely to be hired as a sourced/outbound candidate vs online applicant

  Your Strategy Is Correct

  From the https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/state-of-the-tech-market-in-2025-hiring
  -managers:

  "A significant proportion of hires come via referrals, where a current employee refers an
  engineer whom they know and for whose work they can vouch. These are generally of much
  higher quality than inbound applications. Despite so many inbound applications, many
  companies hire most engineers via reachouts and referrals."

  You're doing this right: 100% referral-based, no portal submissions, network IS the
  pipeline.

  🎯 What's Actually Working in 2025-2026

  1. Referrals Are Non-Negotiable

  - Referrals increase interview chances significantly
  - Hiring managers trust employee vouches > resumes
  - Most Big Tech hires come via referrals or direct outreach

  Your moves:
  - ✅ Isha (Amazon) - warm lead, referral ask Week 8-9
  - ✅ Olivia/Sophia (Elastic) - relationship building via talk
  - ✅ Run clubs, hackathons = relationship building

  2. Multi-Channel Networking Strategy

  From https://blog.theinterviewguys.com/state-of-job-search-2025-research-report/:
  - Build genuine LinkedIn connections at target companies
  - Attend virtual/in-person meetups and events
  - Join professional Slack/Discord communities
  - Informational interviews

  Your moves:
  - ✅ Founders Run Club, ATX Divas Run Club
  - ✅ Hackathons (OpenClaw, YC, UT)
  - ✅ Meetups (AI camp, Women's SWE, Elastic Austin)
  - ✅ LinkedIn engagement with engineers

  3. Build Public Credibility

  From https://www.flashfirejobs.com/blog/how-to-get-a-job-as-a-software-engineer:
  "A portfolio is non-negotiable in 2026. Building projects and networking with people in the
   industry is the open secret to getting a job in 2026."

  Your moves:
  - ✅ Presenting at Elastic Austin meetup (public speaking proof)
  - ✅ Indexing pipeline, image dedup, IoT form redesign (real projects)
  - ✅ LinkedIn content post-talk (proof of technical depth)

  4. Focus on In-Demand Skills

  From https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/software-engineering-job-market-2026:
  - AI/ML roles: up 163% in 2025
  - Security roles: up 124% year over year
  - Cloud, cybersecurity, distributed systems

  Your edge:
  - ✅ Platform engineering angle (infrastructure, scaling)
  - ✅ Search architecture (Elastic talk)
  - ✅ System design prep (DDIA, Grokking)

  ⚠️ What's NOT Working

  1. Cold Applications Are a Black Hole

  - 90%+ applications go through AI screening
  - https://blog.theinterviewguys.com/how-many-applications-it-takes-to-get-hired-in-2025/
  - Companies hire most engineers via referrals/outreach

  You're avoiding this: ✅ No portal submissions without warm intro

  2. Entry-Level Market Is Brutal

  From https://ravio.com/blog/tech-hiring-trends:
  - 73% decrease in entry-level (P1/P2) hiring
  - Companies want engineers who contribute immediately
  - Generalists struggle; specialists thrive

  Your edge:
  - ✅ 3 years experience (not entry-level)
  - ✅ Platform engineering specialization
  - ✅ Real production systems experience

  3. Applying Like a Numbers Game

  From https://blog.theinterviewguys.com/state-of-job-search-2025-research-report/:
  "Stop treating job applications like a numbers game. Spend less time hitting 'submit' and
  more time building relationships."

  You're doing this right: ✅ Quality relationships > quantity applications

  🔥 The Bottom Line

  Your instincts are CORRECT.

  From https://blog.theinterviewguys.com/state-of-job-search-2025-research-report/:
  "The job seekers who succeed fastest aren't necessarily applying to more jobs — they're
  applying smarter, leveraging referrals, and treating their job search like the complex
  strategic game it has become."

  That's exactly what you're doing.

  💡 One Adjustment Based on This Research

  Consider Adding LinkedIn Engagement BEFORE the Carousel

  From the research, LinkedIn engagement (not posting) is valuable:
  - Comment on posts from engineers at target companies
  - Build genuine connections
  - Show you're active and technical

  This costs 10-15 min/week and complements your in-person networking.

  Post carousel AFTER Elastic talk (still the right move), but engage with content NOW (low
  cost, high value).
