longest-path-dag,2026-02-11,Solved,DFS with memoization. Counting edges vs nodes tripped me up.
grid-path-count,2026-02-08,Struggled,Had to look at solution for the bug
max-path-sum,2026-02-08,Struggled,Same or/and bug — didn't catch it despite just seeing it
summing-squares,2026-02-09,Failed,5 bugs: missing return on memo hit; loop over all numbers instead of perfect squares; recursive call didn't reduce n; subtracted 1 from count; unnecessary if/else branch
counting-change,2026-02-09,Watched,Watched walkthrough. Code was correct but need to internalize the pattern.
array-stepper,2026-02-09,Struggled,1 bug: used i as loop variable shadowing the function parameter. Needed 1 hint.
max-palindromic-subsequence,2026-02-09,Struggled,Missed core palindrome check. Wrong slicing logic. Forgot to memo match branch.
can-concat,2026-02-11,Solved,2 bugs: off-by-one in slicing and used or instead of and for prefix match. Fixed with hints.
quickest-concat,2026-02-11,Solved,Extended Can Concat to count min words. Same structure as min coins — min(1 + recurse(remaining)).
valid-compound,2026-02-11,Solved,Word break pattern with pointer optimization. Pre-processed elements to lowercase.
count-compounds,2026-02-11,Solved,Word break counting variant. Fixed base case (return 1 when complete) and initial count.
semesters-required,2026-02-11,Solved,"Kahn's algorithm with level-order BFS. Struggled with indegrees concept, directed graph construction, and queue level processing."
